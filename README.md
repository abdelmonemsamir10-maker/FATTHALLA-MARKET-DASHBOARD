üöÄ Sales Dashboard Project ‚Äì Fathalla Market (Excel Pivot Dashboard)

I developed an interactive sales dashboard in Microsoft Excel using PivotTables and PivotCharts to analyze retail performance across branches, partitions, categories, and products.

üîë Key Metrics (KPIs)

Total Sales: $2,252,780.04

Total Quantity Sold: 6,490,860

Total Orders: 410,516

Branches: 52

Partitions: 33

Categories: 174

üìä Breakdown of Each Visualization

Total Sales by Partition
Shows revenue distribution by major partitions. Clear 80/20 pattern: a few partitions drive the majority of sales. 
Total Sales by Category
Highlights category contribution within partitions. Useful for cross-selling opportunities and rethinking underperforming categories.

Total Sales by Branch
Branch-level sales performance. Clear variance across 52 branches (long tail). Insights for resource allocation, stock distribution, and branch-level strategy.

Top 10 Products by Sales
Revenue drivers. They should be monitored closely to ensure consistent supply, strong visibility in stores, and strategic pricing decisions.

Top 10 Products by Quantity
Volume movers. Often lower-priced items that bring footfall and frequent purchases. Great for bundling and traffic-building.

Bottom 10 Products by Sales
The tail of low-performing products. Potential candidates for clearance, pricing strategy changes, or discontinuation.

Top 10 Branches by Quantity
Identifies branches with the highest customer traffic. Helps optimize staffing, stock replenishment, and in-store operations.

Total Sales & Quantity by Category (Combo)
Combines revenue and volume for each category. Helps calculate Average Selling Price (ASP = Sales √∑ Quantity).
‚Üí High sales but low volume = premium products.
‚Üí High volume but low sales = discount/essential products.

Bottom 5 Branches by Sales (Donut)
Displays contribution of weakest-performing branches. Useful to prioritize improvement initiatives branch by branch.

Average Sales for Branches & Partitions (Heatmap)
Cross-analysis of branch √ó partition. Darker cells = higher sales. Excellent for spotting hidden strengths and replicating success across branches.

Slicers (Branch / Partition)
Interactive filters to instantly update all KPIs and charts, allowing dynamic comparisons.
